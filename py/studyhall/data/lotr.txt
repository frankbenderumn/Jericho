Pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and 
when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It was the face of 
one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and 
now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, 
and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother Boromir – 
whom Pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man’s lordly but 
kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was strangely moved with a 
feeling that he had not known before. Here was one with an air of high nobility 
such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less 
incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but 
touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Elder Race. He knew now why Beregond 
spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would 
follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.
